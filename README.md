Repository of the protobuf service definitions of the dfuse architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These hold Services, and not data. We would like to create small libraries for the Data definitions, alongside some Go code that facilitate their use. For example the Ethereum Block package, it's going to be used here and there, and wrapping them is valuable.. and pulling Go versions is better than generating code in each project based on Data protobufs.
